# GA WDI30 Project 1: 'Flappy Turd'

## Introduction

In week 3 of the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly London, I built a game using Javascript, JQuery, HTML5 and CSS3. 'Flappy Turd' is a humourous take on the game made famous in 2013 and built by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen. 

## Concept 

The idea behind the game is simple but hugely addictive. Using either mouseclicks or the spacebar, the user must keep Flappy Turd airborne. Each time an obstacle is successfully passed, the score is incremented: the game gets faster each time the user goes up a level. The game is set on a sunny day in an animated countryside setting.
